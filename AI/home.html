	<h1>Robotics</h1>
	<p> <strong>Robotics</strong> is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
		<br/>

These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

		<h2>Future Of <em>Humanity</em></h2>
			<p> How Do Robots Explore Other Worlds?<br />

Robots help explore space. Spacecraft that explore other worlds, like the moon or Mars, are robots. These include orbiters, landers and rovers on other planets. The Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity are robots. Other robotic spacecraft fly by or orbit other worlds. These robots study planets from space. The Cassini spacecraft is this type of robot. Cassini studies Saturn and its moons and rings. The Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft are now traveling beyond our solar system. They are also robots. People use computers to send messages to the spacecraft. The robots have antennas that pick up the message commands. Then the robot does what the person has told it to do.

			<h2>Key Trends in AI and Machine Learning</h2>
			
				<p>No trend in the past 10-15 yrs has created as much buzz as <strong>artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)</strong>. During this webinar, we discuss the latest trends in how machine learning drives artificial intelligence, what is enabling AI, where the cutting edge is (including examples), and what the limitations are of current technology. We will also cover the complexities involved when organizations are trying to create their own ML / AI application from scratch and how to overcome them.<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/data-analytics-us/why-attend/featured-topics/topic-machine-learning?ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI4qPKoZ3G4AIVxUGGCh3ZIwAlEAAYBCAAEgIPsvD_BwE:G:s&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=evt_na_2019_bi17_sem&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4qPKoZ3G4AIVxUGGCh3ZIwAlEAAYBCAAEgIPsvD_BwE">Gartner</a> </p>
